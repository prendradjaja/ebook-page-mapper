<div>
  <!-- is (input) the event I want? kinda obnoxious to do stuff on every keypress, but then again that means i don't have to blur to compute. or maybe compute after a delay? eeeeeh -->
  <input type="text" [attr.placeholder]="from" (input)="onFromChange($event.target.value)">
  <input type="text" [attr.placeholder]="to" [attr.value]="computedToValue">
